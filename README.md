Additionally, we've leveraged modern technologies like React, JavaScript, and CSS to provide an amazing user experience. Let's see how you can get started!

## Key Features

1. **Create Tasks:** Add new tasks to your list with just a couple of clicks. Never forget an important task again!

2. **Edit Tasks:** Modify task details as needed. Change the description, due date, or mark a task as complete.

3. **Delete Tasks:** If a task is no longer relevant, simply delete it! Keep your list clean and organized.

## Technologies Used

- **React:** The JavaScript library for building interactive user interfaces.
  
- **JavaScript:** The primary programming language driving the logic behind our application.
